I have uploaded all the files. The only change remaining is to add 3 photos which will be done by 7/11/2018. I made changes in the master branch, but a copy of past code is present in nirav's branch. Backend has to be attached with thses files.
Saujas, kindly look into the same.

I have even uploaded new images. All those images were in a folder named 'ShellEcoImages'. I was not able to upload a folder on github. So if someone clones this repository, he/she wont be able to see the photos without making a new folder.

Also I haven't deleted already existing folder.
